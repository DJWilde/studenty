# studenty
A simple CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) application written in Java using JavaFX. New features will be added in the future.

Here's what an application can do so far:

- load/save students from/to the file
- load faculties
- create, edit and delete students
- in the "Add New Student" dialog, courseComboBox is filled depending on what faculty has been selected.

Planned features:
- simple grading system (user can see student's grades, add, edit them)
